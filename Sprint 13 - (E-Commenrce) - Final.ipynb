    "\n",
    "    - quantity: The number of items ordered on average is around 9.55, with a minimum value of -80995 and a maximum value of 80995.\n",
    "    - item_price: The average item price is approximately 4.61, with prices ranging from -11062.06 to 38970.00.\n",
    "    - customer_id: There are 406,829 unique customer IDs, with an average customer ID of approximately 15287.69.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Outliers: The statistical summary indicates that there are some extreme values in the quantity and item_price columns. Negative quantities and unusually high item prices might be considered outliers and should be investigated further to ensure data quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Missing Values: The statistical summary also reveals that the customer_id column has missing values, as indicated by the difference between the count of total rows and the count of non-null values in that column (541,909 - 406,829 = 135,080 missing values). Handling these missing values appropriately might be necessary for this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Date Format: The order_date column contains dates in a specific format (MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM). It might be beneficial to convert this column to a datetime data type to perform time-based operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings provide valuable initial insights into the dataset, but further data exploration and analysis will be needed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the data, identify patterns, detect trends, and draw meaningful conclusions based on the specific use case and objectives."

    "\n",
    "- The average quantity of items purchased is approximately 7.98, with a standard deviation of 12.58. This indicates that there is variability in the quantity of items bought by customers.\n",
    "- The minimum quantity is 1, which means that at least one item is purchased in each transaction.\n",
    "- The maximum quantity is 100, which suggests that there are some transactions where a relatively large number of items are purchased.\n",
    "- The 25th percentile (Q1) is 1, the median (50th percentile) is 3, and the 75th percentile (Q3) is 10. This indicates that 75% of the transactions involve buying 10 or fewer items, while 50% of the transactions involve buying 3 or fewer items.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Item Price**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The average item price is approximately 3.15, with a standard deviation of 3.02. This indicates that there is variability in item prices.\n",
    "- The minimum item price is 0, which could indicate either free items or potential data errors.\n",
    "- The maximum item price is 18, suggesting that there are some relatively expensive items in the dataset.\n",
    "- The 25th percentile (Q1) is 1.25, the median (50th percentile) is 2.08, and the 75th percentile (Q3) is 4.13. This shows that 75% of the items have a price of 4.13 or less, and 50% of the items have a price of 2.08 or less.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The average quantity and item price give an overall sense of the typical purchase behavior.\n",
    "- The wide range of quantities and item prices suggests diversity in the types of products being sold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further analysis, including data visualization and segmentation, is needed to gain deeper insights into customer behavior and purchase patterns."

This pattern might be influenced by holidays, festivals, or other special occasions during the later months.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The months of November and December show the highest total spending, indicating that these months are likely associated with peak sales and increased customer activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is a significant decrease in total spending in December 2019 compared to the previous months. This could be due to various factors, such as economic conditions, changes in consumer behavior, or specific events during that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The total spending seems to have an overall increasing trend until October 2019, followed by a sharp decline in November and December 2019. This long-term trend could be influenced by various factors like customer acquisition, market dynamics, or changes in product offerings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the analysis of total spending over time by month provides valuable insights into customer purchasing behavior and helps in understanding the seasonal patterns and long-term trends in sales. It also allows businesses to identify the months of peak sales and plan marketing strategies accordingly."

    "Based on the analysis, we can draw the following key conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recency and Monetary Relationship: The scatter plot of recency vs. monetary score for new customers reveals that there is no clear linear relationship between these two factors. It shows that new customers who made their first purchase within the last 30 days (recency=3) have varying monetary scores, ranging from low to high. This suggests that the recency of the purchase does not necessarily dictate the spending amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Monetary Segments: The histogram of monetary scores for new customers with recency=3 and frequency=1 indicates that the majority of new customers fall within the \"Medium\" monetary segment. However, there are also new customers in both the \"High\" and \"Low\" monetary segments. This demonstrates that there is a diverse range of spending behaviors among new customers, and they can be classified into different monetary segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Opportunities for Engagement: The analysis shows that there are new customers who made a purchase with zero monetary value, possibly indicating free or promotional items. These customers represent an opportunity for the business to engage with them and convert them into potential high spenders in the future.\n",

    "Based on the analysis of customers with monetary scores greater than 1000, the key conclusions are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Biggest Spenders: The table shows the top 1571 customers who have spent the most on their purchases. The customer with the highest monetary score is customer ID 14646, with a total expenditure of 149544.20.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recency and Frequency: All the biggest spenders have a recency score of 3, indicating that they made their most recent purchase within the last 30 days. Their frequency score is relatively high as well, with most of them having made multiple purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Monetary Segments: The monetary scores of these biggest spenders are all at the highest segment (monetary score = 3), indicating that they are high-value customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- First Order Date: The `first_order_date` column shows the date of their first purchase. The biggest spenders have made their first purchase at different times, indicating that they are not all recent customers but have been making substantial purchases over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Business Strategy: These biggest spenders are valuable customers for the business. The company can focus on retaining and nurturing these high-value customers to increase their loyalty and encourage repeat purchases. Offering personalized promotions, rewards, and excellent customer service can help maintain a strong relationship with these customers and potentially increase their spending even further.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Potential for Growth: Identifying and understanding the biggest spenders allows the business to analyze their preferences and behavior. This analysis can be used to identify similar potential high-value customers and develop targeted marketing strategies to attract and convert more customers with similar spending patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the biggest spenders are a crucial segment for the business, and targeted efforts to engage and retain them can have a significant impact on the company's revenue and profitability. With 1571 big spender customers, the business should prioritize customer retention and tailor its marketing efforts to cater to the preferences of these high-value individuals"

Targeted marketing campaigns or personalized offers could be employed to win back their loyalty and increase their engagement with the business.\n",

    "\n",
    "The elbow plot demonstrates the relationship between the number of clusters (k) and the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS). As the number of clusters increases, the WCSS generally decreases, indicating that more clusters are better at fitting the data points. However, there comes a point where the rate of improvement in WCSS starts to slow down, resulting in an elbow-like bend in the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing the tabular results, we can observe the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For k=1, the WCSS is 943,271. This represents a single cluster for all data points, resulting in the highest total sum of squares.\n",
    "- As k increases, the WCSS decreases significantly. The reduction is substantial until k=3, where the WCSS is 402,133. This indicates a significant improvement in clustering.\n",
    "- Beyond k=3, the decrease in WCSS becomes less steep, and the improvements are less substantial as more clusters are added.\n",
    "- Considering both the elbow plot and the tabular results, we have chosen k=4 for the k-means algorithm. While k=3 is a reasonable choice, we believe k=4 offers more granular insights and captures additional variations among customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, based on the elbow method evaluation, we recommend using k=4 for the k-means clustering algorithm with the provided selected_features dataset. This decision aims to strike a balance between meaningful clustering and avoiding excessive complexity, allowing for more actionable and interpretable customer segments. With k=4 clusters, the company can effectively target and address the diverse needs and preferences of different customer groups, leading to better customer satisfaction and potentially increased business performance."

    "Based on the updated clustering analysis and the behavior and distribution of the clusters, we can draw the following conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cluster 0:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This cluster contains the majority of customers (43,601 out of 134,753) and is represented by the color blue in the scatterplot.\n",
    "    - The customers in this cluster have a relatively low average quantity (mean: 14.68) and a low average total spending (mean: $30.16).\n",
    "    - This cluster represents customers who make small and relatively inexpensive purchases.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Cluster 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This cluster contains a substantial number of customers (89,706) and is represented by the color green in the scatterplot.\n",
    "    - Customers in this cluster have a moderate average quantity (mean: 5.93) and a moderate average total spending (mean: $14.83).\n",
    "    - This cluster represents a group of customers who make moderate-sized and moderately priced purchases, indicating potential mid-value or occasional customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cluster 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This cluster contains a smaller number of customers (1,434) and is represented by the color red in the scatterplot.\n",
    "    - Customers in this cluster have significantly higher average quantity (mean: 1,800.28) and total spending (mean: $3,337.34).\n",
    "    - This cluster represents a group of customers who make bulk purchases of higher-priced items, indicating potential high-value or wholesale customers.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Cluster 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This cluster contains the smallest number of customers (12).\n",
    "    - Customers in this cluster have exceptionally high average quantity (mean: 36,065.25) and total spending (mean: $66,328.53).\n",
    "    - This cluster represents a small group of customers who make very large and expensive purchases, indicating potential high-value and high-spending clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The clustering analysis has effectively separated customers into four distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior. This information can be valuable for customer segmentation, targeted marketing strategies, and personalized customer engagement. Businesses can use this clustering to tailor their marketing efforts and customer experiences according to the preferences and spending patterns of each group. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cluster 0 customers, represented by the color blue in the scatterplot, might be targeted with promotions or discounts to encourage repeat purchases and build loyalty. These customers make small and relatively inexpensive orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cluster 1 customers, represented by the color green in the scatterplot, might be offered personalized offers or incentives to encourage them to make more frequent and moderate-sized purchases. These customers are potential mid-value or occasional buyers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cluster 2 customers, represented by the color red in the scatterplot, being bulk purchasers, might be provided with special offers or wholesale deals to maintain their loyalty and encourage continued bulk buying. These customers make larger and more expensive purchases, indicating potential high-value or wholesale customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cluster 3 customers, though a small group containing only 12 customers, are significant due to their exceptionally high average quantity and total spending. They represent a select group of customers who make very large and expensive purchases, suggesting they are potential high-value and high-spending clients. Tailoring exclusive offers and personalized services to this segment could help maintain their loyalty and drive further spending.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this clustering analysis enables businesses to gain insights into customer behavior, identify distinct customer segments, and develop targeted marketing strategies for each group. By understanding the preferences and spending patterns of different customer clusters, businesses can enhance customer satisfaction, foster loyalty, and ultimately increase business revenue."

    "Based on the analysis performed on the provided dataset, we have reached several conclusions and recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Customer Segmentation: Through the application of k-means clustering, we successfully segmented customers into four distinct clusters based on their purchase behavior, order quantity, and item preferences.\n",
    "2. Outlier Handling: Outliers in the quantity and item_price columns were identified and handled using the modified interquartile range (IQR) method. Removing outliers ensured more reliable analysis and modeling.\n",
    "3. Cluster Analysis: We further analyzed the four clusters to understand their characteristics and identified the following customer segments:\n",
    "    - Cluster 0: This cluster contains the majority of customers (43,601 out of 134,753) who make smaller orders with relatively lower-priced items. These customers represent regular or casual buyers with moderate engagement and spending.\n",
    "    - Cluster 1: This cluster is the most populated with 89,706 customers who make moderate-sized purchases at moderate prices. They represent a larger group of potential mid-value or occasional buyers.\n",
    "    - Cluster 2: This cluster contains 1,434 customers who make bulk purchases of higher-priced items, indicating potential high-value or wholesale clients.\n",
    "    - Cluster 3: This cluster is the smallest, with only 12 customers, but it represents a group of customers who make exceptionally large and expensive purchases, suggesting potential high-value and high-spending clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Marketing Strategy: Tailor marketing strategies for each cluster based on their characteristics. For example, Cluster 1 customers could be targeted with personalized product recommendations or loyalty programs, while Cluster 0 customers may respond well to promotions or discounts to increase their purchase frequency.\n",
    "2. Customer Retention: Focus on retaining high-value customers in Cluster 3, as they contribute significantly to the revenue. Implement personalized retention tactics, such as exclusive offers or VIP treatment, to keep them engaged and foster loyalty.\n",
    "3. Product Recommendations: Based on the customer segmentation, recommend products that cater to the preferences of each cluster. Analyze the product categories that attract high-value customers (Cluster 2 and 3) and ensure a well-curated product selection to cater to their preferences.\n",
    "4. Inventory Management: Efficiently manage inventory for products that are frequently purchased by different clusters. This will help avoid stockouts for popular items and optimize the inventory turnover rate, especially for products preferred by high-value clusters.\n",
    "5. Pricing Strategy: Based on the insights from Cluster 2 and 3, carefully analyze the pricing strategy for products that attract high-value customers. Price optimization can lead to increased revenue and customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, understanding customer behavior through segmentation and addressing their preferences can help businesses develop targeted marketing strategies, optimize inventory management, and improve overall customer satisfaction. Additionally, handling outliers and ensuring data quality are crucial steps in making accurate business decisions and building reliable predictive models. By implementing the provided recommendations, businesses can enhance customer experiences, drive revenue growth, and build lasting relationships with their diverse customer base."
